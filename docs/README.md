## How to use this index

Read `AGENTS.md`, then this index, then the assigned issue and its exact linked decision before selecting implementation sources. A document describes intent only within its stated subject and authority. Tests, schemas, workflows and code prove current behavior; they do not override a higher-authority product or architecture decision.

Only one document may be CANONICAL for a subject. When two sources of equal or higher authority conflict, stop and report the conflict in the owning issue. Do not reconcile it from code, recency or inference alone.

Historical and audit material is indexed separately for provenance. It is not current implementation authority.

## Executable authority boundaries

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `playwright.release.config.ts` define the two canonical web evidence lanes named in #100.
- `package.json#scripts` is the command registry. Commands prove only the behavior their owning lane declares.
- Prisma schema/migrations support the optional canonical web repository; [`architecture/supabase/README.md`](architecture/supabase/README.md) records the separate experimental/legacy Supabase consumers.
- Docker, Electron Playwright, broad Playwright and PWA artifacts are supporting/advisory evidence, not product support claims.
- GitHub settings applied by #100 are external state. The issue record is the authority; repository prose cannot prove that remote state remains unchanged.

## Active exceptions and provisional decisions

| Source | Scope and effect | Owner | Starts | Ends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Recovery mandate #82](https://github.com/RenyEnnos/life-os/issues/82) | permits autonomous issue/PR/configuration execution, self-merge after evidence, and human review after execution; permanent secret/data/production limits remain | repository maintainer | explicit maintainer mandate | program completion, explicit revocation or a later human decision |
| [Runtime decision #85](https://github.com/RenyEnnos/life-os/issues/85) | web/HTTP canonical; Electron experimental; PWA advisory; Android unsupported | repository maintainer | validated decision | superseding human decision/ADR or mandate termination review |
| [Security decision #87](https://github.com/RenyEnnos/life-os/issues/87) | only local-dev supported; shared modes fail closed until their gates pass | repository maintainer | validated decision | superseding security decision or mandate termination review |
| [Product decision #88](https://github.com/RenyEnnos/life-os/issues/88) | narrow invite-only weekly loop and evidence-bounded claims | repository maintainer | validated decision | ratification, rejection or superseding product decision |
| [GitHub controls #100](https://github.com/RenyEnnos/life-os/issues/100) | PR + two canonical checks for non-bypass actors; admin bypass and zero approvals remain provisional under #82 | repository maintainer | verified configuration | remote reconfiguration or post-mandate governance review |

An exception applies only to its exact recorded scope. The default policy resumes automatically when the exception ends; an agent must not infer a replacement exception from tool access or prior behavior.

## Historical and migration inventory

- Dated evidence remains under [`audits/`](audits/README.md), is immutable, and never authorizes current implementation.
- Superseded desktop and broad-suite narratives remain searchable under [`archive/`](archive/README.md), outside the primary authority path.
- The obsolete MVP checklist and March planning records are preserved under [`archive/`](archive/README.md) and cannot authorize implementation.
- Completed agent plans/specs are preserved by verified issue/PR delivery under [`archive/deliveries/`](archive/deliveries/README.md) and cannot be executed as active instructions.
- Active product, architecture, contract and operations sources use the minimal taxonomy indexed above; #136 owns this path migration.
- Do not link historical plans or archive paths from Quick Start, Key Paths or issue templates as current authority.

## Conflict and update protocol

1. Identify the subject row and exact authority source.
2. Compare scope, state, active exception and update trigger—not filename recency.
3. Treat code/config as observed behavior unless the issue authorizes changing desired intent.
4. Stop on an equal- or higher-authority conflict and link it to the owning issue.
5. Update this index in the same PR whenever a path, state, owner, authority, exception or review date changes.
