# Spec: Atmosphere

## ADDED Requirements

#### Requirement: Global Noise Texture
The application must overlay a static noise texture on all pages to reduce color banding and add tactile depth.
- **Scenario:** User views the dashboard on a high-res screen; gradients appear smooth with a subtle grain.

#### Requirement: Vignette Focus
A radial vignette must subtly darken the edges of the screen to focus attention on the center content.
- **Scenario:** User navigates through the app; the center feels illuminated while corners are slightly dimmed.

#### Requirement: Premium Scrollbars
Scrollbars must be invisible or unobtrusive until hovered, matching the dark theme.
- **Scenario:** User scrolls a long list; the scrollbar appears only when the mouse is near the right edge.
