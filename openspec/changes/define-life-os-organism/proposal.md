# Change: Define Life OS as a Living Organism

## Why
Life OS needs to evolve from a collection of tools into a living, context-aware system that feels like an active nervous system: Nexus with Agora Dinâmico, Synapse with neural resonance powered by NLP, and modules that talk to each other. We must deliver an elite OLED “A Estética do Silêncio” experience, contextual intelligence (hora/tarefas/humor), and symbiotic links (Health ↔ Fluxo) to surpass passive workspace tools like Notion.

## What Changes
- Establish Nexus/Agora as a dynamic, decision-light surface with Deep Glass aesthetics, time-of-day states, and liquid motion.
- Introduce Synapse Neural Resonance using Gemini for NLP, contextual suggestions (hora, tarefas, humor), and safe fallbacks with telemetry.
- Model Health ↔ Fluxo symbiosis (impact vital + custo financeiro) with cross-surface visualizations and decision helpers.
- Mature gamificação com Arquétipos e Visual Legacy, reflecting behavior and progress in a generative gallery.
- Codify Elite Identity (Nexus, Fluxo, Synapse, Sanctuary, Agora, Legacy) and evolve Sanctuary to monochrome + binaural calm mode.

## Impact
- Affected specs: nexus-agora (new), synapse-neural-resonance (new), health-fluxo-symbiosis (new), archetypes-legacy (new), elite-identity (new), sanctuary-mode (modified).
- Affected code: src/features/dashboard (Nexus/Agora), src/features/ai-assistant/Synapse, src/features/health, src/features/tasks (Fluxo), src/features/gamification (Arquétipos/Legacy), src/features/sanctuary, shared theme/tokens, telemetry/observability.
