## 1. Discovery
- [x] 1.1 Review current Nexus/Dashboard and Synapse surfaces to anchor Agora states and data sources.
- [x] 1.2 Map existing Health and Tasks (Fluxo) data structures to define symbiotic link fields (impact vital, custo financeiro).
- [x] 1.3 Confirm Gemini/Groq credentials path and current AI middleware patterns for reuse.

## 2. Design
- [x] 2.1 Draft OLED/Deep Glass token set (cores, blur, elevation, motion) for Nexus/Agora and Sanctuary.
- [x] 2.2 Outline Synapse Neural Resonance flow (intent → Gemini → suggestion) with rate limits, cache, fallbacks.
- [x] 2.3 Define Archetypes signals and Visual Legacy generative inputs.

## 3. Specs
- [x] 3.1 Author nexus-agora requirements (Agora Dinâmico, decisionless CTAs, motion, OLED aesthetic).
- [x] 3.2 Author synapse-neural-resonance requirements (contextual suggestions, NLP, safety, telemetry).
- [x] 3.3 Author health-fluxo-symbiosis requirements (links, impact computation, cross-surface surfacing).
- [x] 3.4 Author archetypes-legacy requirements (assignment, feedback, gallery).
- [x] 3.5 Author elite-identity requirements (terminologia, copy, cohesion).
- [x] 3.6 Modify sanctuary-mode requirements (monochrome mode, binaural audio, calm interactions).

## 4. Validation
- [x] 4.1 Run `openspec validate define-life-os-organism --strict` and fix any validation errors.
